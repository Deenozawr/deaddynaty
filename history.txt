									<p>Pharaoh and i61 began with Twilight Trap and WITCH house. Now music YungRussia and Dead Dynasty traces of the influence of the resurrected and re-buried witch house almost unheard of, and the audience has become much wider, but the feeling of some elusive relationship is difficult to escape: teenage nihilism, stylish poverty aggressive desperation, clips in color smoke or other signs of a new Russian musical world.</p>

									<h2>WHAT ABOUT TEXT?!?</h2>
									<p>As for the texts, the children themselves and from YungRussia Pharaoh builds his texts klipovoy and slang that are difficult to understand by themselves, but together add up to a big picture. Boulevard Depo operates quite differently and in their songs can describe the feeling stuck in a computer photo or grown in Leningrad bumps. He does not like trivial about girls and guns. </p>
									<p>Earlier this year, Dead Dynasty and YungRussia already represented a powerful movement with tens of thousands of fans scattered across Russia and the CIS countries, dozens of artists in the community and the army of loyal fans. Fan base YungRussia envied by many - page Dead Dynasty in "VKontakte" signed more than 80 thousand people. To lost in the depths of "VKontakte" teenage boys from YungRussia unexpectedly almost voice of a generation. VC for them - it is not just a library with porn and "Wikipedia", and something like a fortress, the walls of which were left by their parents</p>

									<h2>FANS</h2>
									<p>Devoted fans to dig deep into the lyrics and even build on its basis a special mythology. Earlier this year, the network shattered video captured Kiev fans Boulevard Depo on one of his tracks and has become a real hit - now at nearly 200,000 video views. How to grow mushrooms and all sorts of parodies projects jokingly alter style YungRussia: someone using their slang and phrases inside, tells the story of the Soviet Union, others sing about the area and beyond..</p>
									<p>This could be another ephemeral, but now Dead Dynasty is actively developing, trying to grow out of public in social networks in a large network with the formation of active cells throughout the country. And looking for the next "guide on how to become a Pharaoh", it is impossible to escape the feeling that all of this will be even louder and more, which is good news against the background of the usual media stream, where some try to judge for tracks about 1990, and others read about health and friendship with the president.</p>
